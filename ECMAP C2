### Static Analysis ###
Static Analysis :Analysing a sample without executing it

This method is divided into two different approaches.
1 - Basic Static Analysis      2 - Advanced Static Analysis

Basi Static Analysis Step :
1 - File Identification and Classification
2 - Scanning
3 - File format Analysis
4 - Identifying Obfuscation


The methods used in malware analysis to identify files
1 - File Types 
2 - File Hashes 
3 - Strings


Note : Every file has a structure that we can identify using the header and may include a trailer or footer.
Tool to identify the type of file : file or using signture
Resorce hacker toll used for change icon of file 
Fuzzy hashing : It is used to compare two files and issue a score of their similarity .

### File Format ###
PE File :(PE File structure)
1- MS-DOs Header
2- File Header
3- Optional Header
4- Section Headers
5- Sections

## Types of linking ## 
1 - Static Linking : At compile time the linker will resolve all the library requirement and copy the library into final executable
    # Type of Static linking
2 - Dybamic Linking :
 # Type of Dynamic linking
        A - Implicit Linking : The linker will link the library referenced into the program, but the library is not added to 
            the executable file and is only loaded at execution time.
            Note: rdata is the suction in the PE structure that holds all the libraries that begin to be imported and the functions referenced.
        B - explicit linking add library in the code
