Digital forensics : , which is the recovery and investigation of artifacts found in digital devices, often in relation to a computer crime

Examples of digital evidence are:
• Pictures produced by cameras
• Print logs saved on printers
• Temporary files produced by a web browser
• Downloaded files
• Email messages
• Deleted files

The Scientific Method is a body of techniques for:
• Investigating phenomena, 
• Acquiring new knowledge, or
• Correcting and integrating previous knowledge[1].

The methodology of scientific :
1-Observing
2-Collecting data and facts
3-Finally building a hypothesis based on datta collected

Digital Evidence Life Cycle:
1-Acquisition
2-Analysis
3-Presentation

##Acquisition is the process of obtaining a forensic sound image (physically or remotely) of the evidence to be analyzed. 


##If the device was off the acquisition will be easier; all the investigator has to do is:

1-Leave the device off
2-Put the evidence in a container
3-Seal the container with tape
4-Write on the tape



##Concealment Steps

• Use digital safe containers for evidence keeping, such as: Antistatic bags and antistatic pads.
• Make sure that those containers are well padded.
• Write notes on the tape to prevent tampering with the evidence.
• Ensure that temperature and humidity ranges are adequate for all evidence


## The most important thing to consider is preserving the original evidence without alteration ?
  ANS : you should create a forensic image of the evidence


According to your hypothesis, the forensic analysis is conducted to generate one of the following:
• Inculpatory Evidence: Supports a hypothesis
• Exculpatory Evidence: Contradicts a hypothesis
• Tampering Evidence: Indicates system tampering with theaim of deception


## presentation : 
# where you should provide:
• A report of your analysis results, by mentioning the artifacts you found 
• Steps you followed to reveal these artifacts
• The tools used for your analysis.



TIP: The amount and types of digital evidence you will have to analyze will differ from case to case and depends on different criteria such as: 
• What evidence you have, 
• If the evidence you found leads you to other clues, 
• In situations where there is a large amount of data, you will only need 
  to extract enough artifacts to incriminate the suspect or explain the incident that occurred.


 ### Data types ###
1- Active Data : This type includes all data and files that are created by the operating system or by a word processor, web browser, mail client,
  or a scanner such as documents, cached files, emails, and images.

2- Archive and Backup Data:Backup data is created by making an identical copy of original files and folders

3- Hidden Data Types :Metadata, Residual data ,Replicant data

# 1 - Metadata : used to provide context or additional information about data and files , EX Date time ,file structure ,file owner

# 2 - Residual data : • This is deleted data on the disk. An important issue to know is that even after data
  deletion occurs the data “might” still be there, but you just cannot see it, for example the directory list of your Windows Explorer.

# 3 - Replicant data : this type of data is generated when a program like word processor creates a temporary copy of an 
opened file, this is needed as a backup to avoid data loss in case an error occurs and the file is forced to close without saving the changes.

Examples of residual data include 

1 - Web cache Temporary 
2 - directories
3 - Data blocks resulting from a move
4 - Memory

# Non-volatile data : All previously mentioned types are considered nonvolatile data, and could be retrieved even if the computer has been turned off.

# Volatile Data : The data that resides in RAM and is acquired only when the device is running. Collecting volatile data is a perilous task

# Computer Network : The network contains the largest amount of data you could ever analyze

## Digital Evidence should have the following characteristics:
• Admissibility- accepted in a court
• Authenticity- relevant to the case
• Complete- no missing information


### Analysis Step ###
DF analysis is defined as scientific method, which starts by gathering facts from the evidence you have, building a hypothesis to explain an incident, and
extracting artifacts to prove or refute this hypothesis.

Analysis Step : 
1- Creating Forensic Image : duplicate of the evidence; a duplicate means it’s bit by bit copying.
2-  Image verifying : , you should make a hash  signature for both the original evidence and its copy and then compare the two hashes to ensure that the 
copy is an accurate duplicate of the evidence
3- Evidence Preservation:  you could put the original evidence in its container again, in a safe place away from humidity, temperature, and other effects
4- Analysis :  This step include several techniques that depends on  the case type the investigator is handling
5- Analysis Validation : Any artifact you extract during the analysis should be validated to ensure its soundness
