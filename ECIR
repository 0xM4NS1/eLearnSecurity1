################ PART 1 ################

The main function of us  as incident Response is :

1- Network analysis 
2- Analysing & detecting

## Communication model type :
1 - OSI(open System Interconnection)
  # A - OSI have 7 layer 
2- TCP/IP 
  # A -  Its a modern


RFC (Request For Comment ) : this is to know if packet normal or upnormal

Tool for traffic analysis Tool : Wireshark / TCP Dump

## Network Access layer / link layer  Protcols :
  1- 802.3 Ethernet
  2- 802.11 wireless

#NIC : Network interface card 

# 802.3 ethernet
Note : The IP layer is responsible for getting the destination Mac address because it supports the ARP protocol. using broad cast 

ARP cache :It's a table that has IP and Mac addresses for every device that I connected to it.

ARP (address resolution protocol ) : this protcol used to now mac address using ip
Note: neighbor solicitation / advertisement : It's a technique used to know a Mac address.
MAC (Media access Control ): unique number 48bit (6 byte) to identifi the device 

## The MAC, we can divide it into two parts.
  1- 3 byte for OUI (Organization unique identifier) the company that makes the network card (ex intel) 
  2- 3 byte for Network interface specific identifier for the company that makes the computer (ex asus / dell )

## ARP disadvantage :
  1-The Mac address cannot be validated for ownership. (ARP Spofing)
  2-ARP is stateless arp replay with out request.(ARP gratuitous)
  3-ARP shortcoming that makes the attacker do the one in the middle attack


## Gratuitous ARP request : This is useful to know if the attacker is impersonating someone else and taking Mac addresses.
## Gratuitous ARP Reply : sent a reply without request; it always seems like an attack.
## ARP spoofing / poisoning : The attacker can inspect the network trafic

note : ARP requests must have src ip, src mac, and dis ip. ARP reply has all this with dis mac, so the attacker must be in the same network.

how to prevernt arp poisoning :

1 - Preventing the registration of any entry on Arab Cache.
2- Change the type of saving from dynamic to static in the ARPCache. 
3- Make arp cache in switch.

ARP watch tool : It is used to provide information about people who are trying to make an ARP attack.

MAC table : have all mac address with port .

IP protocol : IP protocol is responsible for routing my data from my device to another device.

################ PART 2 ################

NOTE : ICMP its work in internet layer

## Suspicious Trafic Analysis ##

Note : When some devices send a SYN request without a response SYN\ACK, its called scan operation .
Note : The same thing happens when a single host sends to multiple ports; it's called a scan or single host to multiple port.

Port [1-1023] for server (Priviledge)
Port [1023-65535] for client(Unpriviledge)

TCP RST Attack: Someone on their own network wants to distribute the network connection.

TCP Haijacking: 

### ICMP ###

ICMP (Internet control message protocol )

The Main function

1-Testing protocol to ensure connect for two device or troubleshooting protocol 
2-We can send messages like unicast, multicast, or broadcast.

SMURF Attack :a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in which an attacker attempts to flood a targeted server with Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets

ICMP Tunneling : ICMP tunneling is a command-and-control (C2) attack technique that secretly passes malicious traffic through perimeter defenses. 
Malicious data passing through the tunnel is hidden within normal-looking ICMP echo requests and echo responses.

Net Bios provide three services

1-NBNS(Net Bios Name Service 137 port) : The main function of this service is to translate the name into an IP address.

2-NBDS(Net Bios datagram distribution Service port 138):

3-NBSS(Net Bios Session Service port 139):It used to establish sessions between hosts,open or save file and execute remote files  


SMP(Server Message Block):that protocol run in NBSS for transaction operations and over NBDS for service announcement
Note: Smp run in session layer

### HTTP ###


###  Suricata ###
Note : Suricata is a network ips, ids, and security network work engine.
