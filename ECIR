The main function of us  as incident Response is :

1- Network analysis 
2- Analysing & detecting

## Communication model type :
1 - OSI(open System Interconnection)
  # A - OSI have 7 layer 
2- TCP/IP 
  # A -  Its a modern


RFC (Request For Comment ) : this is to know if packet normal or upnormal

Tool for traffic analysis Tool : Wireshark / TCP Dump

## Network Access layer / link layer  Protcols :
  1- 802.3 Ethernet
  2- 802.11 wireless

#NIC : Network interface card 

# 802.3 ethernet
Note : The IP layer is responsible for getting the destination Mac address because it supports the ARP protocol. using broad cast 

ARP cache :It's a table that has IP and Mac addresses for every device that I connected to it.

ARP (address resolution protocol ) : this protcol used to now mac address using ip
Note: neighbor solicitation / advertisement : It's a technique used to know a Mac address.
MAC (Media access Control ): unique number 48bit (6 byte) to identifi the device 

## The MAC, we can divide it into two parts.
  1- 3 byte for OUI (Organization unique identifier) the company that makes the network card (ex intel) 
  2- 3 byte for Network interface specific identifier for the company that makes the computer (ex asus / dell )

## ARP disadvantage :
  1-The Mac address cannot be validated for ownership. (ARP Spofing)
  2-ARP is stateless arp replay with out request.(ARP gratuitous)
  3-ARP shortcoming that makes the attacker do the one in the middle attack


## Gratuitous ARP request : This is useful to know if the attacker is impersonating someone else and taking Mac addresses.
## Gratuitous ARP Reply : sent a reply without request; it always seems like an attack.
## ARP spoofing / poisoning : The attacker can inspect the network trafic

note : ARP requests must have src ip, src mac, and dis ip. ARP reply has all this with dis mac, so the attacker must be in the same network.

how to prevernt arp poisoning :

1 - Preventing the registration of any entry on Arab Cache.
2- Change the type of saving from dynamic to static in the ARPCache. 
3- Make arp cache in switch.

ARP watch tool : It is used to provide information about people who are trying to make an ARP attack.

MAC table : have all mac address with port .

IP protocol : IP protocol is responsible for routing my data from my device to another device.
