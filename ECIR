The main function of us  as incident Response is :

1- Network analysis 
2- Analysing & detecting

## Communication model type :
1 - OSI(open System Interconnection)
  # A - OSI have 7 layer 
2- TCP/IP 
  # A -  Its a modern


RFC (Request For Comment ) : this is to know if packet normal or upnormal

Tool for traffic analysis Tool : Wireshark / TCP Dump

## Network Access layer / link layer  Protcols :
  1- 802.3 Ethernet
  2- 802.11 wireless

#NIC : Network interface card 

# 802.3 ethernet
Note : The IP layer is responsible for getting the destination Mac address because it supports the ARP protocol. using broad cast 

ARP cache :It's a table that has IP and Mac addresses for every device that I connected to it.

ARP (address resolution protocol ) : this protcol used to now mac address using ip
Note: neighbor solicitation / advertisement : It's a technique used to know a Mac address.
MAC (Media access Control ): unique number 48bit (6 byte) to identifi the device 

## The MAC, we can divide it into two parts.
  1- 3 byte for OUI (Organization unique identifier) the company that makes the network card (ex intel) 
  2- 3 byte for Network interface specific identifier for the company that makes the computer (ex asus / dell )

## ARP disadvantage :
  1-The Mac address cannot be validated for ownership. (ARP Spofing)
  2-ARP is stateless arp replay with out request.(ARP gratuitous)
  3-ARP shortcoming that makes the attacker do the one in the middle attack


## Gratuitous ARP request : This is useful to know if the attacker is impersonating someone else and taking Mac addresses.
## Gratuitous ARP Reply : sent a reply without request; it always seems like an attack.
